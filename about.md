Hello! My 30+ year career spans exciting changes from classic waterfall development to agile methods such as Kanban and SCRUM. The languages and technology stacks may have changed, but I have always kept up to date with best practices. My path has been one of a pendulum moving between development and management which allows me to provide many useful insights.

I can design and implement complex components and systems, provide architectural design, relevant design documentation, test planning and execution. After clean design and coding of simple solutions to complex problems, I dive into application profiling and performance tuning to deliver best results.
Often tasked with the evaluatation of new standards and technologies, and the selection of software development libraries and tools, I mentor other developers, and enjoy working with product managers, and application experts to ensure that requirements are satisfied.

If you're interested in what I can offer your company, please contact me!
