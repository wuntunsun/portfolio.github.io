Hello! My 30+ year career spans exciting changes from classic waterfall development to agile methods such as Kanban and SCRUM. The languages and technology stacks may have changed, but I have always kept up to date with best practices. My path has been one of a pendulum moving between development and management which allows me to provide many useful insights.

If you're interested in what I can offer your company, please contact me!
