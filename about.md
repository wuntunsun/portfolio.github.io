Hello! My 30+ year career spans exciting changes from classic waterfall development to agile methods such as Kanban and SCRUM. The languages and technology stacks may have changed, but I have always kept up to date with best practices. My career path has been a pendulum moving between development and management, allowing me to provide valuable insights.

I can design and implement complex components and systems, provide architectural design, relevant design documentation, test planning and execution. After the clean design and coding of simple solutions to complex problems, I dive into application profiling and performance tuning to deliver the best results. Often tasked with evaluating new standards and technologies and selecting software development libraries and tools, I mentor other developers and enjoy working with product managers and application experts to ensure that requirements are satisfied.

If you're interested in what I can offer your company, please contact me!
