Hello! My 30+ year career spans exciting changes from classic waterfall development to agile methods such as Kanban and SCRUM. The languages and technology stacks may have changed, but I have always kept up to date with best practices. My path has been one of a pendulum moving between development and management which allows me to provide many useful insights.

I was born in the UK and moved to Berlin in the late 90s where I met the mother of my two children. We are now separated but have a good relationship. I consider myself a stoic in the classic sense of the word, which helps me to passionately address the things I can change but to accept the things that are not in my power to influence.

If you're interested in what I can offer your company, please contact me!
